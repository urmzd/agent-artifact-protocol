# Agent-Artifact Protocol (AAP) Specification

**Version**: 0.1
**Status**: Draft — subject to breaking changes
**Date**: 2026-04-02

## 1. Introduction

Large language models regenerate entire artifacts on every edit — a report, a dashboard, a source file — even when only a single value changed. This wastes tokens, increases latency, and inflates cost.

The **Agent-Artifact Protocol (AAP)** is a portable, format-agnostic standard that defines how structured artifacts are declared, generated, updated, streamed, and reprovisioned with minimal token expenditure. Any LLM, agent framework, or rendering tool can implement it.

### 1.1 Design Goals

1. **Token efficiency** — express changes in the fewest tokens possible
2. **Format agnostic** — HTML, source code, JSON, YAML, Markdown, diagrams, configs
3. **Incremental by default** — full regeneration is the fallback, not the norm
4. **Streaming native** — every operation works over a stream
5. **Backward compatible** — raw content (no envelope) remains valid input
6. **Progressively adoptable** — conformance levels let implementations start simple
7. **Universal message format** — every interaction is an envelope: artifact content, diffs, projections, edit intents, results, and audit entries all share the same structure

### 1.2 Relationship to Existing Standards

| Standard | Relationship |
|---|---|
| [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) (JSON Patch) | Diff operations borrow semantics for JSON artifacts |
| [Unified Diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Unified-Format.html) | Text diff operations use unified diff addressing |
| [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) | Template syntax is a subset of Mustache |
| [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) | All protocol structures have machine-validatable schemas |

---

## 2. Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Artifact** | A discrete unit of structured content (an HTML page, a source file, a config) |
| **Envelope** | Universal JSON message carrying artifact identity, operation metadata, and content |
| **Section** | A named, addressable region within an artifact |
| **Chunk** | A unit of streamed content within a chunk frame |
| **Operation** | The `operation` object in an envelope — metadata about the action being performed |
| **Direction** | Whether an envelope is `"input"` (to the system) or `"output"` (from the system) |
| **Generation** | The act of producing artifact content (initial creation or update) |
| **Reprovisioning** | Updating an existing artifact to a new version |
| **Token budget** | Maximum token allocation for a generation |
| **Flush point** | A semantically meaningful boundary where partial content can be rendered |
| **Orchestrator** | Agent that manages artifacts via handles and projections — never holds full content |
| **Init context** | Secondary context specialized for artifact creation — produces `name: "full"` or `name: "manifest"` envelopes. May be an LLM call, agent, tool invocation, or any bounded execution context |
| **Maintain context** | Secondary context specialized for edits and summaries — produces diff/section/template/projection envelopes. Requires only the current artifact revision and an instruction; can use cheaper or smaller models than the orchestrator |
| **Apply engine** | Deterministic code that resolves envelope operations against stored artifacts (CPU, not LLM) |
| **Entity state** | Lifecycle state of a managed artifact (`draft`, `published`, `archived`) |
| **Advisory lock** | Non-mandatory lock hint to coordinate concurrent editors |
| **SSE binding** | Normative Server-Sent Events wire format for streaming ([AAP-SSE](aap-sse.md)) |

---

## 3. Artifact Model

### 3.1 Envelope

Every protocol-aware payload is wrapped in an **envelope** — a JSON object with six top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protocol` | string | YES | Protocol identifier. MUST be `"aap/0.1"` |
| `id` | string | YES | Unique artifact identifier (UUID or user-supplied) |
| `version` | integer | YES | Monotonically increasing version number (starts at 1). For non-`full` operations, the apply engine validates `stored_version == version - 1` |
| `name` | string | YES | Operation discriminator (see [Section 4](#4-operations)) |
| `operation` | object | YES | Metadata about the action (see below) |
| `content` | array | YES | List of content objects — shape determined by `name` |

The `name` field determines what the envelope represents and what shape the `content` items take. There are 11 operation names:

**Artifact operations:** `full`, `diff`, `section`, `template`, `composite`, `manifest`

**Control-plane operations:** `handle`, `projection`, `intent`, `result`, `audit`

#### 3.1.1 Operation Object

The `operation` object carries metadata about the action:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `direction` | string | YES | `"input"` (to the system) or `"output"` (from the system) |
| `format` | string | YES* | MIME type of the artifact content (`text/html`, `text/x-python`, `application/json`, etc.). *Not required for `audit` |
| `encoding` | string | no | Character encoding. Default: `"utf-8"` |
| `content_encoding` | string | no | Compression: `"gzip"` or `"zstd"`. Applied to body fields |
| `section_id` | string | no | Section this result fills (for parallel section results) |
| `token_budget` | object | no | Token budget constraints (see [Section 7](#7-token-budgeting)) |
| `tokens_used` | integer | no | Actual tokens consumed to produce this payload |
| `checksum` | string | no | `sha256:<hex>` integrity hash of the resolved content |
| `created_at` | string | no | ISO 8601 timestamp of initial creation |
| `updated_at` | string | no | ISO 8601 timestamp of this version |
| `state` | string | no | Entity lifecycle state: `"draft"`, `"published"`, `"archived"` (see [Section 10](#10-artifact-entity-state)) |
| `state_changed_at` | string | no | ISO 8601 timestamp of last state transition |

The `operation` object is extensible — implementations MAY add additional fields for vendor-specific or future extensions.

#### 3.1.2 Content Array

The `content` field is always an **array of objects**. This enables parallel operations in a single envelope — multiple diff operations, multiple edit intents, multiple audit entries — without requiring separate tool calls or API requests.

The shape of each content item is determined by `name`. See [Section 4](#4-operations) for the content schema of each operation name.

**Example** (minimal full envelope):

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "full",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "body": "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Dashboard</h1></body></html>",
      "sections": [{"id": "stats"}, {"id": "users"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.2 Sections

An artifact MAY be divided into named **sections** — addressable regions that enable targeted updates. Section definitions are carried in the `content[0].sections` array of a `name: "full"` envelope.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YES | Unique section identifier within the artifact |
| `label` | string | no | Human-readable label |
| `start_marker` | string | no | Format-specific start boundary |
| `end_marker` | string | no | Format-specific end boundary |

Section markers use a universal XML-style format across ALL text-based content types. The `aap:` namespace prefix makes markers uniquely identifiable and LLMs follow XML tag patterns reliably. If a section definition provides explicit `start_marker` and `end_marker`, those override the defaults.

| Format | Start marker | End marker |
|---|---|---|
| All text formats | `<aap:section id="ID">` | `</aap:section>` |
| JSON (`application/json`) | N/A (use JSON Pointer paths via `pointer` targeting in diff operations) | N/A |

> **Design note:** A single universal marker format is used rather than format-specific comment styles (e.g., `<!-- -->`, `// #region`, `# region`). LLMs are trained on vast amounts of XML and reliably reproduce XML tags. The `aap:` namespace prevents collisions with application content. Models MAY hallucinate slight variations; implementations SHOULD apply fuzzy matching when locating markers.

**Example** (sections in any format):

```html
<aap:section id="stats">
<div class="stats">...</div>
</aap:section>

<aap:section id="users-table">
<table>...</table>
</aap:section>
```

### 3.3 Version Chain

Every artifact maintains a version chain. Version numbers are monotonically increasing integers starting at 1. For any non-`full` operation, the apply engine validates that the stored version equals `version - 1` (optimistic concurrency). If the stored version does not match, the operation is rejected as a conflict.

```
v1 (full) → v2 (diff) → v3 (section) → v4 (full)
```

A `name: "full"` envelope resets the chain — no version validation is required.

---

## 4. Operations

The `name` field declares what the envelope represents and how `content` items are shaped. Producers SHOULD select the most token-efficient operation for the change at hand.

### 4.1 Full (`name: "full"`)

Complete artifact content. This is the baseline — most expensive, always correct.

**When to use**: initial creation, major rewrites, or when diff overhead exceeds content size.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `body` | string | YES | Full artifact content |
| `sections` | array | no | Section definitions (see [Section 3.2](#32-sections)) |

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "report-42",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "full",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "body": "<html><body><h1>Q4 Report</h1>...</body></html>",
      "sections": [{"id": "summary"}, {"id": "charts"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.2 Diff (`name: "diff"`)

Express changes as operations against the previous version. Each `content` item is a diff operation applied sequentially.

**When to use**: small, localized changes (value updates, line insertions, deletions).

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `op` | string | YES | `"replace"`, `"insert_before"`, `"insert_after"`, `"delete"` |
| `target` | object | YES | Addressing (see below) |
| `content` | string | no | New content (required for `replace`, `insert_before`, `insert_after`) |

#### Target Addressing

A target identifies where in the artifact the operation applies. Exactly one addressing mode MUST be used:

| Address mode | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Section | `{"section": "id"}` | Target an entire section by ID |
| Line range | `{"lines": [start, end]}` | Target lines (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| Offset range | `{"offsets": [start, end]}` | Target character offsets (0-indexed, exclusive end) |
| Search | `{"search": "literal text"}` | Target first occurrence of literal text |
| Pointer | `{"pointer": "/path/to/value"}` | Target a value by JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) — for `application/json` and `application/yaml` formats |

**Pointer targeting semantics:**
- `replace`: `content` MUST be a valid JSON value. Replaces the value at the pointer location.
- `delete`: Removes the key from an object or the element from an array (shifting subsequent indices).
- `insert_before` / `insert_after`: The pointer MUST reference an array element (last segment must be a non-negative integer). Inserts the new value before/after that index.
- Non-existent paths MUST produce an error. Pointer operations do not auto-create intermediate paths.
- Re-serialization may alter original formatting and comments.

**Example** (update two stat card values in a single envelope):

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 2,
  "name": "diff",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "target": {"search": "<span class=\"stat-value\">$12,340</span>"},
      "content": "<span class=\"stat-value\">$15,720</span>"
    },
    {
      "op": "replace",
      "target": {"search": "<span class=\"stat-value\">1,205</span>"},
      "content": "<span class=\"stat-value\">1,342</span>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.3 Section (`name: "section"`)

Regenerate only targeted sections. All other sections are preserved from the previous version. Each `content` item is a section replacement.

**When to use**: one or a few sections need significant changes, but the rest is unchanged.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YES | Section ID to replace |
| `content` | string | YES | New content for this section |

**Example** (replace the users table):

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 3,
  "name": "section",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "id": "users-table",
      "content": "<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>Email</th></tr>...</table>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.4 Template (`name: "template"`)

Define a skeleton with named slots, then fill only the slots. Templates eliminate boilerplate regeneration.

**When to use**: generating variants of a known structure (dashboards with different data, reports with different periods, config files for different environments).

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `template` | string | YES | Template content with `{{slot_name}}` placeholders, or a registered template ID |
| `bindings` | object | YES | Map of slot name to content string |

Slot syntax follows [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/):

- `{{name}}` — variable substitution (HTML-escaped by default)
- `{{{name}}}` — unescaped substitution
- `{{#items}}...{{/items}}` — iteration
- `{{#condition}}...{{/condition}}` — conditional block
- `{{^condition}}...{{/condition}}` — inverted conditional

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 4,
  "name": "template",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "template": "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>{{title}}</h1><div>{{{stats_html}}}</div></body></html>",
      "bindings": {
        "title": "Q1 Dashboard",
        "stats_html": "<div class='stat'><span>Revenue</span><span>$15,720</span></div>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.5 Composite (`name: "composite"`)

Assemble an artifact from referenced sub-artifacts or external URIs. Enables deduplication of shared components. Each `content` item is an include reference.

**When to use**: artifacts that share components (common nav bars, shared CSS, reusable code modules).

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ref` | string | Reference to another artifact: `"artifact_id"` or `"artifact_id:section_id"` |
| `uri` | string | External URI to fetch content from |
| `content` | string | Inline content (fallback if ref/uri unavailable) |
| `hash` | string | Expected `sha256:<hex>` of resolved content |

Exactly one of `ref`, `uri`, or `content` MUST be present per item.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "full-page",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "composite",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {"ref": "shared-header"},
    {"content": "<main><h1>Page Content</h1></main>"},
    {"ref": "shared-footer"}
  ]
}
```

### 4.6 Manifest (`name: "manifest"`)

Declare artifact structure and section assignments for parallel generation. Each `content` item contains the skeleton and section prompts.

**When to use**: parallelizing initial generation across multiple agents.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `skeleton` | string | YES | Static scaffold with section markers (boilerplate, layout, shared CSS) |
| `section_prompts` | array | YES | Per-section generation instructions |

Each `section_prompt` entry:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | YES | Section ID (matches marker in skeleton) |
| `prompt` | string | YES | Generation instruction for this section |
| `dependencies` | array | no | Section IDs that must complete before this one starts |
| `token_budget` | integer | no | Max tokens for this section |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "manifest",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "skeleton": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<body>\n<aap:section id=\"nav\"></aap:section>\n<aap:section id=\"stats\"></aap:section>\n<aap:section id=\"users\"></aap:section>\n</body>\n</html>",
      "section_prompts": [
        {"id": "nav", "prompt": "Generate a navigation bar with logo and user menu"},
        {"id": "stats", "prompt": "Generate 4 stat cards: users, revenue, orders, uptime"},
        {"id": "users", "prompt": "Generate a users table with 50 rows", "dependencies": ["stats"]}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.7 Control-Plane Operations

The following operation names support the Artifact Type Interface ([Section 8](#8-artifact-type-interface)). They use the same envelope structure as artifact operations.

| Name | Direction | Purpose | Content item schema |
|---|---|---|---|
| `handle` | output | Lightweight artifact reference for orchestrators | `{sections, token_count?, state?, entity?}` |
| `projection` | output | Structured summary of an artifact | `{projection_type, token_count, sections?, changes?, outline?, summary?, statistics?}` |
| `intent` | input | Edit request from orchestrator | `{intent, target_sections?, constraints?, priority?, idempotency_key?}` |
| `result` | output | Outcome of an edit operation | `{status, mode_used, changes, tokens_used?, rejection_reason?, conflict_detail?, checksum?}` |
| `audit` | output | Operation record | `{entry_id, operation, actor, timestamp, version_before?, version_after?, detail?, status?, error?, tokens_used?}` |

See [Section 8](#8-artifact-type-interface) for detailed schemas, examples, and usage patterns.

### 4.8 Content Encoding (Compression)

Any operation MAY compress its content body fields using `operation.content_encoding`:

- `"gzip"` — gzip compression (RFC 1952)
- `"zstd"` — Zstandard compression (RFC 8878)

Compressed content MUST be base64-encoded in JSON. The `operation.checksum` field, if present, applies to the **uncompressed** content.

---

## 5. Reprovisioning

Reprovisioning is the act of updating an existing artifact. The producer selects a strategy based on the scope of change.

### 5.1 Section-First Generation (Recommended)

Producers SHOULD emit section markers on the **initial full generation**. This incurs a small overhead (~2% extra tokens for markers) but enables all subsequent updates to use `section` or `diff` operations — reducing **output tokens** by 90-99% per update compared to full regeneration. Actual dollar savings depend on the model's output/input price ratio (see [Section 8.1.1](#811-cost-model)).

**Rationale**: the upfront cost of markers is amortized across every future update. After just one `section` update, the total output token spend is lower than two full regenerations.

**Guidelines for section placement**:
- Place section boundaries at **independently meaningful blocks** (navigation, stat cards, data tables, forms, sidebars)
- Aim for **5-15 sections** per artifact — too few limits granularity, too many adds overhead
- Each section should be **self-contained**: updating one section should not require changes to another
- Avoid nesting sections deeper than 2 levels

**Output cost model** (N = number of future updates, S = artifact size in output tokens):
- Without sections: N full regenerations = N × S output tokens
- With sections: 1 full (with markers) + N section updates = S × 1.02 + N × section_tokens output tokens
- Break-even: 1 update (section_tokens is typically 1-10% of S)

> **Note:** Input costs are roughly equal in both cases — the maintain context reads the full artifact regardless of operation type. The savings concentrate on the output side, where tokens are 3-5× more expensive. See [Section 8.1](#81-memory-model) for the full cost derivation.

### 5.2 Parallel Generation

When an artifact has well-defined sections, the initial generation can be **parallelized** — each section is generated by an independent agent running concurrently, then assembled into the final artifact.

#### 5.2.1 Manifest

A **manifest** declares the artifact structure and section assignments before generation begins. It is an envelope with `name: "manifest"` (see [Section 4.6](#46-manifest-name-manifest)).

#### 5.2.2 Orchestration Flow

```
                    ┌─── Agent 1 ──▶ nav section ───────┐
Manifest ──parse──▶ ├─── Agent 2 ──▶ stats section ─────┼──▶ Assembler ──▶ Full Artifact
                    ├─── Agent 3 ──▶ users section ──────┤
                    └─── Agent 4 ──▶ orders section ─────┘
                                     (waits for stats)
```

1. **Parse manifest**: extract skeleton and section prompts
2. **Dispatch**: launch one generation per section, respecting `dependencies`
3. **Collect**: each agent returns a section envelope (`name: "full"`, scoped via `operation.section_id`)
4. **Assemble**: stitch section content into the skeleton at marker positions
5. **Store**: save the assembled artifact as version 1 with all section markers intact

Sections without `dependencies` run concurrently. Sections with dependencies wait for their prerequisites to complete before starting.

#### 5.2.3 Section Results

Each parallel agent returns a **section result** — an envelope with `operation.section_id` identifying which section it fills:

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "full",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html", "section_id": "stats", "tokens_used": 450},
  "content": [
    {"body": "<div class=\"stats\">...</div>"}
  ]
}
```

The assembler collects all section results and inserts each between its markers in the skeleton.

#### 5.2.4 Latency and Cost Model

| Strategy | Wall-clock latency | Total tokens | Tool calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sequential full | sum(section_times) | full_tokens | 1 |
| Parallel sections | max(section_times) | full_tokens + manifest_overhead | N + 1 |
| Parallel + update | max(section_times) + update_time | full_tokens + section_tokens | N + 2 |

**Manifest overhead** is minimal — the skeleton and prompts are typically 5-10% of the full artifact tokens.

#### 5.2.5 Parallel Updates

The same pattern applies to updates. When multiple sections need regeneration, dispatch them in parallel using a manifest with only the sections that changed:

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 2,
  "name": "manifest",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "skeleton": null,
      "section_prompts": [
        {"id": "stats", "prompt": "Update stat cards with Q2 data"},
        {"id": "orders", "prompt": "Add 10 new order rows"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Only the listed sections are regenerated. The assembler merges results into the existing artifact, preserving unchanged sections.

### 5.3 Strategy Selection Guide

| Change scope | Recommended operation | Output token reduction |
|---|---|---|
| Single value change | `diff` (search/replace) | ~95-99% |
| Few lines changed | `diff` (line range) | ~90-98% |
| One section rewritten | `section` | ~80-95% |
| Multiple sections rewritten | `section` | ~50-80% |
| Same structure, different data | `template` | ~90-98% |
| Complete rewrite | `full` | 0% (baseline) |

> **Interpreting the table:** the "Output token reduction" column measures how many fewer output tokens the LLM produces compared to full regeneration. Because output tokens are priced 3-5× higher than input tokens (varies by provider), a 95% output reduction translates to roughly 75-80% total cost reduction when input costs are included. See [Section 8.1.1](#811-cost-model) for the precise formula.

### 5.4 Version Chain Integrity

1. Each non-`full` envelope MUST have `version` equal to `stored_version + 1`
2. The apply engine MUST verify this before applying
3. On mismatch: reject the operation, notify the producer of the current version
4. The producer SHOULD re-derive its update against the correct version

### 5.5 Rollback

Consumers SHOULD maintain a configurable version history (default: 10 versions). Rollback replaces the current content with a previous version and increments the version number.

---

## 6. Streaming Protocol

Streaming is orthogonal to operation name — any operation can be streamed. Streamed payloads are delivered as **JSONL** (one JSON object per line).

### 6.1 Chunk Frame

Each streamed unit is a **chunk frame**:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `seq` | integer | YES | Monotonically increasing sequence number (starts at 0) |
| `content` | string | YES | Chunk payload |
| `section_id` | string | no | Section being streamed (if applicable) |
| `flush` | boolean | no | Hint to render/apply accumulated content. Default: `false` |
| `final` | boolean | no | `true` on the last chunk. Default: `false` |

The first chunk frame (`seq: 0`) SHOULD include the envelope metadata (all fields except `content`) in an `envelope` field. Subsequent frames carry only chunk data.

**Example** (streaming a full artifact):

```jsonl
{"seq":0,"envelope":{"protocol":"aap/0.1","id":"doc-1","version":1,"name":"full","operation":{"direction":"output","format":"text/html"}},"content":"<!DOCTYPE html><html>","flush":true,"final":false}
{"seq":1,"content":"<head><title>Report</title></head>","flush":true,"final":false}
{"seq":2,"content":"<body><h1>Q4 Report</h1>","flush":false,"final":false}
{"seq":3,"content":"<p>Revenue increased by 15%.</p></body></html>","flush":true,"final":true}
```

### 6.2 Flush Strategies

Producers SHOULD emit `flush: true` at semantically meaningful boundaries:

| Strategy | Description | Flush overhead | Render quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Token-aligned** | Flush every token | High | Smooth but expensive |
| **Syntax-aligned** | Flush at tag/statement boundaries | Low | Clean partial renders |
| **Size-aligned** | Flush every N bytes | Low | May split mid-tag |
| **Adaptive** | Start small (responsiveness), grow chunks over time | Low | Best overall |

**Recommended**: adaptive strategy with syntax-aligned flush points.

### 6.3 Transport

The protocol is transport-agnostic. Reference transports:

| Transport | Description |
|---|---|
| **File write + poll** | Write JSONL to a file; consumer polls for changes |
| **Server-Sent Events** | Each chunk frame is an SSE `data:` line |
| **WebSocket** | Each chunk frame is a WebSocket text message |
| **stdio** | Each chunk frame is a line on stdout |

A normative SSE transport binding is defined in [AAP-SSE](aap-sse.md).

---

## 7. Token Budgeting

### 7.1 Budget Declaration

The `operation.token_budget` object declares constraints:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_tokens` | integer | Maximum content tokens (excludes envelope overhead) |
| `priority` | string | `"completeness"` (prefer full content), `"brevity"` (prefer concise), `"fidelity"` (prefer accuracy) |
| `max_sections` | integer | Maximum sections to regenerate (for `section` operations) |

### 7.2 Budget Accounting

- **Content tokens**: tokens in the artifact payload (what the user sees)
- **Overhead tokens**: envelope metadata, framing, operation descriptions
- The budget applies to **content tokens only**
- Producers MUST NOT exceed `max_tokens`
- Producers SHOULD select the most token-efficient operation to stay within budget

### 7.3 Reporting

The final envelope (or final chunk frame) MUST include `operation.tokens_used` — the actual content tokens consumed. This enables consumers to track token efficiency over time.

## 8. Artifact Type Interface

When agents manage artifacts through conversation, three costs compound: **context bloat** (KV cache grows with edit history), **token waste** (content written twice — once to read, once to regenerate), and **hallucination** (agents "remember" content they no longer have in context). The Artifact Type Interface eliminates all three by defining a contract built on two principles:

1. **The artifact is the only persistent state.** Between edits, everything is discarded — system prompts, intents, envelope operations. Only the artifact revision survives.
2. **The AI dispatches; the CPU splices.** Envelope operations (diffs, section updates) are produced by a secondary context and resolved by the apply engine deterministically, at zero token cost. Content is never written twice.

### Context Offloading

The core architectural principle is **context offloading**: the orchestrator delegates artifact operations to **ephemeral secondary contexts** and remains completely unaware of artifact content. It provides a mechanism — a tool call, API, subprocess, or any invocable interface — through which operations are dispatched. The secondary context loads the artifact, processes the instruction, returns a result (a handle, projection, or envelope), and terminates. The orchestrator never sees the artifact body; it only sees the structured responses that come back through the mechanism it provided.

This is the abstraction that saves context: the orchestrator can create artifacts (via init), ask questions about them (via projections), request edits (via intents), and receive confirmations (via results) — all without the artifact content ever entering its context window. Even initial generation is offloaded: the orchestrator passes creation instructions to an init context and receives a handle back. The mechanism is the boundary. Everything behind it is invisible to the orchestrator.

Artifact storage is implementation-specific — the artifact can live anywhere (database, file system, object store, in-memory). What matters is that the secondary context can load it for the duration of an operation. The orchestrator holds only handles and operates through the mechanism.

A secondary context is any ephemeral execution scope that is invoked with a bounded input (artifact + instruction), produces a structured output (an envelope), and terminates. The mechanism for invoking it can be anything:

- A tool call that triggers an LLM inference with a fresh context window
- A tool call to a different, cheaper model than the orchestrator
- An API request to an external service
- A subprocess or function invocation
- The same model with different parameters (temperature, system prompt)

The protocol defines two **roles** for these secondary contexts — what they do, not what they are:

- **Init context** — specialized for creation. Takes generation instructions, produces `name: "full"` or `name: "manifest"` envelopes with well-placed section markers. Runs once per artifact (or on re-initialization). After completion, context is discarded.
- **Maintain context** — specialized for reading existing content and producing AAP envelopes. Has two output modes:
  - **Edit:** receives artifact + edit intent → produces `name: "diff"`, `name: "section"`, or `name: "template"` envelopes
  - **Summarize:** receives artifact + summarize request → produces `name: "projection"` envelopes
  - Context per call: `[system prompt] + [artifact vN] + [instruction]`. Discarded after each call.
- **Apply engine** — deterministic code (not an LLM). Receives envelopes, resolves them against stored artifacts (~2μs, 0 tokens), validates operations, stores new revisions.

These roles are separate because they have fundamentally different computational requirements. The init context is *generative* — it creates structure, places section boundaries, produces layout. This benefits from more capable, larger models. The maintain context is *surgical* — it reads existing content and produces minimal structured diffs. This requires only high recall (find the right location in the artifact) and structured output (emit valid envelope JSON). Smaller, cheaper models excel at this constrained task.

This asymmetry is where the second dimension of cost savings emerges. AAP reduces the *number* of output tokens (diffs instead of full regeneration), but context offloading also reduces the *cost per token* — the maintain context can run on a model that costs a fraction of what the orchestrator or init context uses. The two effects multiply: fewer tokens × cheaper tokens.

```
Orchestrator (handles, projections, user conversation)
    │
    ├── create ──→ Init context ──→ name:"full" envelope ──→ Apply engine ──→ Store ──→ name:"handle"
    │
    ├── summarize ──→ Maintain context ──→ name:"projection" envelope ──→ (returned to orchestrator)
    │
    └── edit ──→ Maintain context ──→ name:"diff" envelope ──→ Apply engine ──→ Store ──→ name:"result"
```

> **Non-normative note:** A common realization is two LLM agents with different system prompts, models, and temperature settings behind tool-call interfaces. But the architecture is not prescriptive about mechanism. Any implementation where the orchestrator provides a mechanism to dispatch operations to ephemeral secondary contexts — and those contexts operate on less data than the orchestrator holds — is compliant.

Because the artifact is a concrete, standalone piece of content (an HTML file, a Python module, a config), it can also be interacted with directly — outside any orchestrator context. A user can open it in a browser, edit it by hand, or load it into a fresh LLM context for fine-tuning. This is particularly useful for iterative refinement: abandon the orchestrator, work with the artifact directly in a dedicated context, then resume protocol-managed operations by re-registering the modified artifact as a new version. The protocol's version chain accommodates this — a `name: "full"` envelope resets the chain without requiring continuity from the previous version.

### 8.1 Memory Model

Each secondary context invocation is a **stateless dispatch** — an independent call with no conversation history. The artifact is the single source of truth.

**Init context (runs once):**

```
[Instructions (creation-specialized)] + [Generation prompt]
                    ↓ produces ↓
[name:"full" envelope with section markers]
                    ↓ apply engine (CPU) ↓
[Artifact v1] ← stored, context discarded
```

**Maintain context (runs per edit):**

```
[Instructions (maintenance-specialized)] + [Artifact vN] + [Edit intent]
                    ↓ produces ↓
[name:"diff" envelope with operations]
                    ↓ apply engine (CPU) ↓
[Artifact vN+1] ← sole survivor, context discarded
```

**Maintain context (runs per summarize):**

```
[Instructions (maintenance-specialized)] + [Artifact vN] + ["Summarize: structure"]
                    ↓ produces ↓
[name:"projection" envelope] ← returned to orchestrator, context discarded
```

In every case: instructions are re-injected next time. Intent is discarded. Envelope operations are consumed by the apply engine and discarded. Previous edits never existed in the current context. Only the artifact persists.

**Normative requirements:**

- The orchestrator MUST expose a mechanism (tool calls, API dispatch, or equivalent) through which it can operate on artifact handles — creating, editing, summarizing, and reading artifacts via secondary context invocations
- Implementations MUST NOT accumulate edit history in any secondary context
- Each invocation MUST start with a fresh context
- The maintain context MUST produce envelope operations (`diff`, `section`, or `template`) on edits — the apply engine resolves them against the stored artifact
- The maintain context SHOULD NOT produce `name: "full"` envelopes on edits — this defeats the model by writing content tokens twice
- The init context SHOULD produce artifacts with section markers ([Section 5.1](#51-section-first-generation-recommended)) to enable efficient subsequent edits
- The artifact content is the single source of truth, not conversation memory

#### 8.1.1 Cost Model

The cost of artifact operations depends on three LLM-specific variables that vary across providers and models:

| Variable | Definition | Typical range |
|---|---|---|
| S_k | Artifact size in tokens at version k (tokenizer-dependent) | 500–10,000 |
| d_k | Diff/section envelope size in output tokens for edit k | 30–500 |
| I | System prompt + instructions in tokens | 200–1,000 |
| p_in | Price per input token | varies by model |
| p_out | Price per output token | varies by model |
| r | Output/input price ratio (p_out / p_in) | 1–5× |
| N | Number of edits over the artifact's lifetime | 1–∞ |

> **Why these variables matter:** A given 8 KB HTML artifact might tokenize to ~2,000 tokens on GPT-4's tokenizer but ~2,400 on Claude's. The output/input price ratio ranges from 1× (some open-source providers) to 5× (frontier models). These differences change the absolute savings but not the structural advantage — AAP always reduces output tokens, and output tokens are always ≥ input token price.

##### Three Scenarios

To understand where savings come from, compare three approaches to making N edits on an artifact. The formulas use S_k for artifact size at version k and d_k for diff envelope size at edit k.

**Scenario A — Naive conversation (single growing context, full regen):**

The LLM accumulates conversation history. At edit k, the context contains all prior versions.

| Component | Input tokens | Output tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Edit k | I + S_0 + S_1 + ... + S_{k-1} + intents | S_k |
| Total (N edits) | N·I + Σ_{j=0}^{N-1} (N-j)·S_j | Σ_{k=0}^{N} S_k |

Input cost grows **superlinearly** — each prior version is re-read in every subsequent turn. When S_k is stable, this simplifies to O(N²·S).

**Scenario B — Stateless full regen (fresh context, full output):**

Each edit starts a fresh context with the current artifact, but the LLM still regenerates the full content.

| Component | Input tokens | Output tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Edit k | I + S_{k-1} + intent | S_k |
| Total (N edits) | Σ_{k=0}^{N} (I + S_k) | Σ_{k=0}^{N} S_k |

Input cost is **linear** in N — context offloading eliminates the superlinear growth. But output cost is unchanged: the LLM regenerates the full artifact every time.

**Scenario C — AAP (fresh context, diff output):**

Each edit starts a fresh context. The LLM reads the full artifact but produces only a diff envelope.

| Component | Input tokens | Output tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Init (create) | I + prompt | S_0 |
| Edit k | I + S_{k-1} + intent | d_k |
| Total (N edits) | I + Σ_{k=1}^{N} (I + S_{k-1}) | S_0 + Σ_{k=1}^{N} d_k |

Input cost is **identical to Scenario B** (both read the current artifact per edit). Output cost drops from Σ S_k to S_0 + Σ d_k. Since d_k ≪ S_k for targeted edits, this is the primary savings.

##### Where the Savings Come From

The fundamental trade: **spend input tokens to read the artifact, produce a small diff as output, and let the CPU apply it.** The diff output is consumed by the deterministic apply engine — it never re-enters any LLM context. Meanwhile, the orchestrator (the main conversation) never reads the artifact at all; it holds only lightweight handles and can ask targeted questions via projections. This architecture produces three independent, compounding savings.

**Effect 1 — Output tokens are consumed, not re-read (C vs B).**

In Scenario B (stateless full regen), every edit produces S_k output tokens — the full artifact, regenerated. Those S_k tokens are the product, but producing them is the expensive part: output tokens cost r× more than input tokens.

In Scenario C (AAP), the LLM produces d_k tokens — a diff envelope describing what changed. The apply engine resolves the diff against the stored artifact deterministically (CPU, ~2μs, zero tokens) and stores the new version. The d_k output tokens are **consumed by the apply engine and discarded** — no LLM ever reads them back as input.

The maintain context does re-read the full artifact (S_{k-1} input tokens) each edit — that's how it knows what to diff against. But input tokens are cheap (1/r of the output price). The trade is always profitable: pay S_{k-1}·p_in to read, save (S_k − d_k)·p_out on output. Since r ≥ 1 and d_k ≪ S_k, the output savings dominate.

**Effect 2 — The orchestrator never reads the artifact (context separation).**

In a naive conversation (Scenario A), the main context holds the full artifact — and every prior version. Each regeneration (S_k output tokens) becomes part of the context for the next edit (S_k input tokens). You write S_0, it gets read back next turn, you write S_1 on top of it, and now the following turn reads S_0 + S_1. Every output S_j paid in round j is paid again as input in rounds j+1, j+2, ..., N. This is the mechanism behind superlinear growth.

AAP eliminates this through **context separation**:

- The **orchestrator** (main context) holds only handles (~10 tokens) and projections (~100 tokens). It never reads the artifact body. It can ask specific questions about the artifact via projection requests without loading the content. Its context grows only with conversation, not with artifact size.
- The **maintain context** is ephemeral — it loads the current artifact revision (S tokens), produces a diff (d tokens), and terminates. Its context is discarded after each call.
- The **apply engine** is pure CPU. It consumes the diff envelope, splices it into the stored artifact, and stores the new version.

A crucial distinction: the maintain context *does* read the applied result of all prior edits — the artifact at version k reflects every diff that was ever applied. But it reads only the **current artifact** (S_k tokens), not the **edit history** (all prior envelopes, conversations, and regenerations). The diff envelope itself (d tokens) is consumed by the apply engine and never re-enters any LLM context. What the maintain context sees is the *product* of prior edits, not the *process*.

Note that S_k (artifact size at version k) is not fixed — it may grow if an operation adds content, or shrink if content is deleted. In the cost formulas, S represents the artifact size at the time of each edit. The key property is that S_k depends only on the artifact's content, not on the number of prior edits or the size of prior conversations. In a naive conversation, context at edit k is proportional to k·S (all prior versions); in AAP, input at edit k is always I + S_k — bounded by the artifact's current size, not its history.

> **Alternative: projections instead of full read.** In principle, the maintain context could receive a projection of the artifact instead of the full content, reducing input below S. But this risks reduced recall — the maintain context needs high fidelity over the artifact to produce accurate diffs (targeting the right search strings, correct line numbers). Frontier models have sufficient recall over full artifacts that reading S input tokens is the pragmatic choice: better diff accuracy outweighs the input token savings.

The input savings (A→C) over N edits:

```
Input_A - Input_C = Σ_{j=0}^{N-1} (N-j)·S_j - Σ_{k=1}^{N} (I + S_{k-1})
```

When S_k is roughly stable (S_k ≈ S), this simplifies to ≈ S·N²/2 — quadratic in N. The longer the artifact lives, the more AAP saves on input *in addition to* saving on output.

**Effect 3 — Model cost asymmetry.** The maintain context (which produces diffs) can run on a cheaper model than the orchestrator or init context. A small model with good recall and structured output is sufficient for producing diffs against content it can see in full. If the maintain model costs c_m per output token and the init/orchestrator model costs c_o, the effective per-edit output cost is d_k·c_m instead of S_k·c_o.

These effects multiply: **fewer output tokens × cheaper per token × no context accumulation.**

##### Per-Edit Cost Comparison

The **total cost** of a single edit (init excluded) under each scenario. Edit k (1-indexed):

| | Input cost (edit k) | Output cost (edit k) | Total (edit k) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A (naive convo)** | (I + Σ_{j<k} S_j)·p_in | S_k·p_out | (I + Σ_{j<k} S_j)·p_in + S_k·p_out |
| **B (stateless full)** | (I + S_{k-1})·p_in | S_k·p_out | (I + S_{k-1})·p_in + S_k·p_out |
| **C (AAP diff)** | (I + S_{k-1})·p_in | d_k·p_out | (I + S_{k-1})·p_in + d_k·p_out |

**C vs B (same input, less output):** Input costs are identical — the maintain context reads the full artifact regardless. Savings are purely on the output side: (S_k − d_k)·p_out per edit. This is the diff efficiency.

**C vs A (less input AND less output):** At edit k, Scenario A reads all prior artifact versions (Σ_{j<k} S_j) that Scenario C never sees. Input savings grow with k — the longer the artifact lives, the wider the gap. Output savings (S_k − d_k)·p_out apply on top.

This is why the output/input price ratio matters: the higher r = p_out/p_in, the more the output reduction dominates total savings. But even at r = 1, AAP saves on both sides vs the naive conversation.

The **cost savings percentage** for a single edit (B→C), using S for S_{k-1} ≈ S_k and d for d_k:

```
savings% = (S − d) · p_out / [(I + S) · p_in + S · p_out]
         = (S − d) · r / [(I + S) + S · r]
```

Where r = p_out / p_in. As r → ∞, savings% → (S − d) / S ≈ 1 (approaches the raw output token reduction). As r → 1, savings% ≈ (S − d) / (I + 2S) (approaches roughly half the output reduction, since input and output cost equally).

> **Non-normative note:** The d_k ≈ 30-500 output token estimate is derived from hand-crafted envelope benchmarks. AI-generated envelopes from natural language intents may produce larger diffs or fall back to section-mode rewrites when a targeted diff would suffice. Implementations SHOULD track actual output token counts via the audit log to calibrate expectations.

#### 8.1.2 Amortization

The initial creation (init context, `name: "full"`) is the most expensive operation — full output tokens to produce the artifact with section markers. This is a one-time investment that makes every subsequent edit cheap.

##### Iteration-by-Iteration Comparison

Total **cumulative cost** after each edit (init + N edits):

| | Init | After 1 edit | After 5 edits | After 10 edits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A (naive convo)** input | I | I + (I+S) | I + 5I + 15S | I + 10I + 55S |
| **A** output | S | 2S | 6S | 11S |
| **B (stateless full)** input | I | I + (I+S) | I + 5(I+S) | I + 10(I+S) |
| **B** output | S | 2S | 6S | 11S |
| **C (AAP)** input | I | I + (I+S) | I + 5(I+S) | I + 10(I+S) |
| **C** output | S | S + d | S + 5d | S + 10d |

The output rows tell the story. After N edits:

- **B and A** produce (N+1)·S output tokens
- **C** produces S + N·d output tokens
- **Output savings** = N·(S − d) tokens

##### Concrete Example

An 8 KB HTML dashboard artifact with typical model pricing:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| S | 2,000 tokens | ~4 bytes/token average for HTML |
| d | 30 tokens | Small diff: update two stat values |
| I | 500 tokens | System prompt + AAP instructions |
| r (p_out/p_in) | 4× | Typical frontier model ratio |
| N | 10 edits | Moderate lifecycle |

**Output tokens (cumulative):**

| Edit # | B: Stateless full | C: AAP diff | C saves |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Init | 2,000 | 2,000 | 0 |
| 1 | 4,000 | 2,030 | 1,970 |
| 2 | 6,000 | 2,060 | 3,940 |
| 5 | 12,000 | 2,150 | 9,850 |
| 10 | 22,000 | 2,300 | 19,700 |

**Dollar cost (output only, at $15/M output tokens):**

| Edit # | B output cost | C output cost | C saves |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Init | $0.030 | $0.030 | $0.000 |
| 1 | $0.060 | $0.030 | $0.030 |
| 5 | $0.180 | $0.032 | $0.148 |
| 10 | $0.330 | $0.035 | $0.296 |

**Dollar cost (total: input + output, at $3.75/M input, $15/M output):**

| Edit # | A (naive convo) | B (stateless full) | C (AAP diff) | C vs B saves | C vs A saves |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Init | $0.032 | $0.032 | $0.032 | 0% | 0% |
| 1 | $0.071 | $0.069 | $0.039 | 43% | 45% |
| 5 | $0.304 | $0.217 | $0.070 | 68% | 77% |
| 10 | $0.763 | $0.402 | $0.107 | 74% | 86% |

The three columns reveal the two savings mechanisms:

- **B vs A** (input savings from context flattening): $0.763 → $0.402 at edit 10. The naive conversation re-reads every prior regeneration; stateless dispatch reads only the current version.
- **C vs B** (output savings from diff operations): $0.402 → $0.107 at edit 10. Same input cost, but output drops from S to d per edit.
- **C vs A** (both effects combined): $0.763 → $0.107 at edit 10 — **86% total savings**. The gap widens with every edit because both quadratic input growth *and* redundant output accumulate in A but not in C.

> **Sensitivity to price ratio:** At r = 1 (equal input/output pricing), the same scenario yields ~49% total savings after 10 edits. At r = 5, it reaches ~78%. The output token reduction is constant regardless — what changes is how much of total cost it represents.

##### With Model Asymmetry

If the maintain context runs on a model costing 1/10th the orchestrator's output price (e.g., a small model for structured diffs), the output cost column for C drops further. In the example above, 10 edits of AAP diff output at 1/10th price: $0.035 × 0.1 = $0.0035 — effectively free. Total savings approach the theoretical maximum.

##### Break-Even

Break-even occurs at **one edit**. After a single diff update, cumulative output spend (S + d) is less than two full regenerations (2S) whenever d < S — which is always true for any non-trivial artifact.

#### 8.1.3 Why Savings Are LLM-Dependent

The three variables that determine actual dollar savings are all model-specific:

**Tokenizer efficiency.** The same 8 KB HTML file tokenizes to different counts across models. Byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers average 3-4 bytes/token for English prose but vary for code, markup, and non-Latin scripts. S_k (artifact size in tokens) is not a fixed number — it depends on both the model and the artifact's current content. However, d_k/S_k (the ratio of diff to full) is relatively stable across tokenizers because both numerator and denominator scale similarly.

**Output/input price ratio (r).** This is the single most important factor for translating output token reduction into dollar savings. At r = 5, output tokens dominate cost and AAP captures most of the total. At r = 1, output and input cost equally and AAP captures roughly half.

| r (p_out/p_in) | Output % of edit cost (no AAP) | AAP total savings % (d/S = 1.5%) |
|---|---:|---:|
| 1× | 44% | ~43% |
| 2× | 62% | ~60% |
| 3× | 71% | ~69% |
| 4× | 76% | ~74% |
| 5× | 80% | ~78% |

**Model cost per token.** The maintain context does not require a frontier model — it needs recall (find the right location in the artifact) and structured output (emit valid envelope JSON). Smaller, cheaper models excel at this constrained task. When the maintain model is cheaper than the orchestrator, the savings multiply beyond what output token reduction alone provides.

> **Non-normative note:** Implementations SHOULD report both output token reduction (model-independent) and estimated cost savings (model-dependent) in their benchmarks. Payload byte reduction (as measured by the Rust apply engine) is a useful proxy for output token reduction but not identical — envelope JSON overhead adds a small constant.

#### 8.1.4 Anti-Hallucination Properties

The architecture structurally reduces hallucination through context separation:

- The **orchestrator** never sees full artifact content. It holds only handles and projections. It can describe *intent* but cannot hallucinate *content* it has never seen.
- The **init context** produces content from instructions — hallucination risk is inherent to generation, but its context is clean.
- The **maintain context** sees the *actual current revision*, injected fresh from storage. It produces diffs against real content, not imagined content.
- The **apply engine** is deterministic code. It either applies the operations correctly or returns an error.

> **Non-normative note:** The maintain context *can* still hallucinate envelope operations — for example, targeting a search string that doesn't exist. However, the risk is structurally lower because: (1) the context contains *only* the artifact and the instruction; (2) the apply engine validates operations deterministically; (3) the artifact is always smaller than a full conversation thread. Implementations SHOULD track hallucination rates via the audit log. See [Section 8.4.4](#844-error-recovery) for the recommended recovery flow.

### 8.2 Handle (`name: "handle"`)

A **handle** is an envelope the orchestrator holds instead of full artifact content. It provides enough metadata for decision-making without consuming context budget.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sections` | array of strings | YES | Section IDs present in the artifact |
| `token_count` | integer | no | Approximate token count of the full artifact |
| `state` | string | no | Entity lifecycle state |
| `entity` | object | no | Entity metadata (see [Section 10.2](#102-entity-metadata)) |

> **Non-normative note:** Orchestrators SHOULD independently track the version of their most recent projection to detect staleness (compare against `handle.version`).

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 5,
  "name": "handle",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html", "state": "published", "updated_at": "2026-03-29T14:30:00Z"},
  "content": [
    {"sections": ["nav", "stats", "users", "orders"], "token_count": 10240}
  ]
}
```

### 8.3 Projection (`name: "projection"`)

A **projection** is an envelope containing a compact, structured summary of an artifact. It gives the orchestrator enough information to make decisions without loading full content.

#### 8.3.1 Projection Types

| Type | Description | Approximate cost vs full artifact |
|---|---|---|
| `structure` | Section IDs, labels, token counts. No content | 5-10% |
| `content_summary` | Natural-language summary of what the artifact contains | 10-20% |
| `change_summary` | What changed between two versions | 2-5% |
| `statistics` | Numerical metrics: token count, section count, word count, timestamps | ~50-100 tokens (fixed) |
| `full_summary` | Combined `structure` + `content_summary` | 15-25% |

> **Non-normative note:** `structure` and `statistics` projections can be computed deterministically by parsing section markers and counting tokens — no inference call required. `content_summary`, `change_summary`, and `full_summary` require an inference call via the maintain context. Implementations SHOULD prefer CPU-computable projections when the orchestrator only needs structural information.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `projection_type` | string | YES | One of the types above |
| `token_count` | integer | YES | Token count of the full artifact (not the projection) |
| `sections` | array | no | Section summaries (for `structure` and `full_summary`) |
| `changes` | array | no | Change descriptions (for `change_summary`) |
| `outline` | string | no | Textual outline or table of contents (for `structure`) |
| `summary` | string | no | Natural-language content summary (for `content_summary`) |
| `statistics` | object | no | Numerical metrics (for `statistics`) |

Each section summary contains: `id`, `label`, `token_count`, `summary`.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 5,
  "name": "projection",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {
      "projection_type": "structure",
      "token_count": 10240,
      "outline": "HTML dashboard with 4 main sections",
      "sections": [
        {"id": "nav", "label": "Navigation", "token_count": 820, "summary": "Top nav bar with logo, search, and user menu"},
        {"id": "stats", "label": "Statistics Cards", "token_count": 1200, "summary": "4 stat cards: users (1,247), revenue ($15,720), orders (384), uptime (99.7%)"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 8.3.2 Staleness

A projection is stale when its `version` is less than the artifact's current version. Orchestrators MUST compare the projection's `version` against the handle's `version`.

When a projection is stale, the orchestrator SHOULD request a `change_summary` projection to understand what changed — rather than requesting a full new projection. This keeps the catch-up cost proportional to the changes, not the artifact size.

### 8.4 Edit Intent and Edit Result

The edit delegation pattern separates **intent** from **execution**. The orchestrator formulates *what* should change; the maintain context — with the actual content in context — decides *how* and produces the minimal envelope operations.

#### 8.4.1 Intent (`name: "intent"`)

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `intent` | string | YES | Natural-language description of the desired change |
| `target_sections` | array of strings | no | Section IDs the edit should affect (scoping hint) |
| `constraints` | object | no | Constraints: `max_tokens`, `preserve_structure`, `mode_hint`, `validation` |
| `priority` | string | no | `"completeness"`, `"brevity"`, `"fidelity"` |
| `idempotency_key` | string | no | Client-supplied key to prevent duplicate execution |

The `intent` field SHOULD be self-contained: any data the maintain context needs that is not present in the artifact itself SHOULD be included in the intent text.

Multiple intents can be batched in a single envelope for parallel processing:

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 5,
  "name": "intent",
  "operation": {"direction": "input", "format": "text/html"},
  "content": [
    {"intent": "Update revenue to $18,500", "target_sections": ["stats"]},
    {"intent": "Add 10 new order rows", "target_sections": ["orders"]}
  ]
}
```

#### 8.4.2 Result (`name: "result"`)

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | YES | `"applied"`, `"rejected"`, `"partial"`, `"conflict"` |
| `mode_used` | string | YES | Operation name the maintain context selected |
| `changes` | array | YES | Summary of what changed (per-change: `section_id`, `description`) |
| `tokens_used` | integer | no | Output tokens consumed (the envelope operations, not the artifact) |
| `rejection_reason` | string | no | Why the edit was rejected |
| `conflict_detail` | string | no | Version mismatch information |
| `checksum` | string | no | `sha256:<hex>` of the artifact after the edit |

**Status semantics:**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `applied` | Edit fully executed as intended |
| `rejected` | Edit could not be performed (invalid intent, constraint violation, validation failure) |
| `partial` | Some changes succeeded, others did not. `changes` lists what was applied |
| `conflict` | Version mismatch — the artifact was modified since the intent was formulated |

On `conflict`, the orchestrator SHOULD: request a `change_summary` projection to understand what changed, then reformulate its intent against the current version.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 6,
  "name": "result",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html", "tokens_used": 65, "checksum": "sha256:a1b2c3..."},
  "content": [
    {
      "status": "applied",
      "mode_used": "diff",
      "changes": [{"section_id": "stats", "description": "Updated revenue to $18,500"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 8.4.3 Conflict Resolution Flow

```
Orchestrator                        Store / Maintain context
    |                                       |
    |── name:"intent" (version=5) ─────────▶|
    |                                       |── stored is v7 ──▶ conflict
    |◀── name:"result" (status: conflict) ──|
    |                                       |
    |── name:"projection" request ─────────▶|
    |◀── name:"projection" (changes v5→v7) ─|
    |                                       |
    |── name:"intent" (version=7) ─────────▶|
    |                                       |── inject artifact v7 + intent
    |                                       |── maintain context produces diff
    |                                       |── apply engine → v8
    |◀── name:"result" (status: applied) ───|
```

#### 8.4.4 Error Recovery

When the maintain context hallucinates a bad diff — for example, targeting a search string that doesn't exist — the apply engine rejects the operation. The result envelope returns `status: "rejected"` with a `rejection_reason`.

**Recommended recovery flow:**

1. Orchestrator reads the `rejection_reason`
2. Orchestrator requests a `content_summary` projection of the relevant section
3. Orchestrator reformulates the intent with more specific context from the projection
4. Retry with the maintain context
5. If repeated failures, escalate to re-initialization: archive the current artifact and call the init context

> **Restructuring:** When an artifact's section topology is fundamentally inadequate, the recommended approach is to archive the existing artifact and create a new one via the init context. The init context's instructions MAY include a projection of the old artifact for continuity. There is no in-place restructuring operation — restructuring is creation.

### 8.5 Audit (`name: "audit"`)

Every operation on an artifact produces an audit entry. The audit log enables the orchestrator to maintain awareness of what has been asked and what was produced — without holding full content.

**Content item schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `entry_id` | string | YES | Unique audit entry identifier |
| `operation` | string | YES | `"create"`, `"read"`, `"summarize"`, `"edit"`, `"state_transition"` |
| `actor` | string | YES | Principal that performed the operation (`type:id` format) |
| `timestamp` | string | YES | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `version_before` | integer | no | Artifact version before the operation |
| `version_after` | integer | no | Artifact version after the operation |
| `detail` | object | no | Operation-specific detail |
| `status` | string | no | `"success"`, `"failure"`, `"partial"`. Default: `"success"` |
| `error` | string | no | Error description if `status` is `"failure"` |
| `tokens_used` | integer | no | Tokens consumed by the operation |

Failed edits MUST produce audit entries. The `status` field is `"failure"`, the `error` field describes why, and `detail.intent` preserves the original intent.

Multiple audit entries can be batched in a single envelope:

**Example:**

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 6,
  "name": "audit",
  "operation": {"direction": "output"},
  "content": [
    {
      "entry_id": "audit-001",
      "operation": "edit",
      "actor": "agent:orchestrator",
      "timestamp": "2026-03-29T14:02:00Z",
      "version_before": 5,
      "version_after": 6,
      "status": "success",
      "tokens_used": 65,
      "detail": {"intent": "Update revenue to $18,500", "mode_used": "diff"}
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Non-normative note:** Query parameters for the audit log (filtering by time, operation type, actor, status) are implementation-specific. The protocol defines the audit entry schema, not the query API.

### 8.6 Operations Summary

The Artifact Type Interface defines five abstract operations, all expressed as envelopes:

| Operation | Input envelope | Output envelope | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create` | `name: "full"` or `name: "manifest"` | `name: "handle"` | Create artifact, return handle |
| `read` | *(implementation-specific)* | `name: "full"` (scoped) | Read content — for agent injection, NOT orchestrators |
| `summarize` | *(implementation-specific)* | `name: "projection"` | Compact summary for orchestrator |
| `edit` | `name: "intent"` | `name: "result"` | Dispatch edit via stateless model |
| `audit` | *(implementation-specific)* | `name: "audit"` | Retrieve interaction history |

**Normative:** Orchestrators MUST use projections rather than reads to inspect artifact content, and MUST use intents rather than directly producing content envelopes.

> **Parallel edits:** When multiple independent edits target non-overlapping sections, the orchestrator MAY batch multiple intents in a single `name: "intent"` envelope. The resulting envelopes are applied sequentially by the apply engine. This follows the same pattern as parallel manifest updates ([Section 5.2.5](#525-parallel-updates)).

---

## 9. Scope: Text Artifacts

AAP produces structured text artifacts — HTML, SVG, source code, configuration files, Markdown, and similar text-based formats. How those artifacts are displayed or rendered is **outside the protocol's scope** and is the responsibility of the consuming application.

Consumers may render artifacts using browsers, PDF generators, terminal viewers, IDE panels, or any other tool appropriate to the artifact's MIME type. The `operation.format` field communicates the artifact's content type to aid consumers in selecting an appropriate renderer, but the protocol does not prescribe rendering behavior.

> **Non-normative note:** For binary output formats (PDF, PPTX, DOCX, images), the recommended pattern is to produce the intermediate text representation (HTML, SVG, XML) as the AAP artifact, then use an external tool to convert to the final format. This keeps the protocol's diff, section, and template operations fully functional on the artifact content.

### 9.1 Extension to Messages

> **Non-normative.** This subsection describes an anticipated extension path, not a validated capability. No conformance requirements apply.

LLM conversation messages are `application/json` — structurally identical to any artifact AAP already handles. A message history array can be treated as a versioned artifact and updated with the same operations: pointer-based diffs (`/messages/2/content`), section operations, and templates apply without protocol changes.

In a conventional conversation, every correction or refinement appends a new message. Context grows with each turn, earlier errors persist, and the model must reconcile contradictions spread across history. The alternative: treat the message history as a versioned artifact and patch previous messages in-place using diff envelopes. Corrections modify the original message directly. The edit instruction and diff envelope are ephemeral — consumed by the apply engine and discarded. Only the patched messages survive. This is the same context offloading pattern described in [Section 8](#8-artifact-type-interface), applied to the conversation itself.

The trade-off is precision for flat context growth. Producing diff envelopes costs more output tokens per turn than appending a short follow-up, but context consumption stays proportional to the current message state plus small per-turn diffs rather than growing with interaction count. The agent self-heals — earlier messages stay accurate instead of being contradicted by later ones.

Message content within the JSON structure is free-form text — less structurally stable than typical artifacts — so search-based and line-based diff targeting within message bodies may be less precise. Pointer targeting on the message array itself (by index) remains exact.

---

## 10. Artifact Entity State

Artifacts can optionally be treated as **managed entities** with lifecycle states, ownership, relationships, and expiration. All entity fields are optional — Level 0-3 consumers ignore them.

### 10.1 State Machine

```
              publish           archive
  ┌─────────┐ ──────▶ ┌───────────┐ ──────▶ ┌──────────┐
  │  draft   │         │ published  │         │ archived  │
  └─────────┘ ◀────── └───────────┘         └──────────┘
              unpublish          restore
                                  ◀──────────────────────
```

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `draft` | Work-in-progress. MAY be updated freely. Not visible to downstream consumers |
| `published` | Stable release. Updates create new versions; artifact is considered live |
| `archived` | Retired. Read-only. No further updates permitted until restored |

**Transitions:**

| Transition | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| `publish` | draft | published |
| `unpublish` | published | draft |
| `archive` | published | archived |
| `restore` | archived | published |

State is carried in the `operation.state` field. State transitions are recorded in `operation.state_changed_at`.

### 10.2 Entity Metadata

The optional `entity` object (carried in `content` for `name: "handle"` envelopes) holds ownership and organizational metadata:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner` | string | no | Owning user or system identifier |
| `created_by` | string | no | Creator identifier |
| `tags` | array of strings | no | Freeform classification tags |
| `permissions` | object | no | Access control (see [Section 10.3](#103-permissions)) |
| `collection` | string | no | Workspace or collection grouping identifier |
| `ttl` | integer | no | Time-to-live in seconds from `operation.updated_at` |
| `expires_at` | string | no | ISO 8601 expiration timestamp (takes precedence over `ttl`) |
| `relationships` | array | no | Links to other artifacts (see [Section 10.4](#104-relationships)) |

**Example** (handle envelope with entity metadata):

```json
{
  "protocol": "aap/0.1",
  "id": "dashboard-001",
  "version": 3,
  "name": "handle",
  "operation": {"direction": "output", "format": "text/html", "state": "published"},
  "content": [
    {
      "sections": ["nav", "stats", "users"],
      "token_count": 10240,
      "entity": {
        "owner": "user:alice",
        "created_by": "agent:claude",
        "tags": ["dashboard", "q4", "revenue"],
        "collection": "workspace:finance-team",
        "ttl": 86400,
        "permissions": {
          "read": ["team:finance", "user:bob"],
          "write": ["user:alice", "agent:claude"],
          "admin": ["user:alice"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 10.3 Permissions

The `permissions` object uses a role-based model:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | array of strings | Principals that can read the artifact |
| `write` | array of strings | Principals that can update the artifact |
| `admin` | array of strings | Principals that can change state, permissions, and delete |

Principal identifiers follow the format `<type>:<id>` (e.g., `"user:alice"`, `"team:finance"`, `"agent:claude"`, `"*"` for public). Enforcement is outside protocol scope — this is metadata for the platform to act on.

### 10.4 Relationships

Artifacts can declare typed relationships:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | string | YES | Relationship type: `"depends_on"`, `"parent"`, `"child"`, `"derived_from"`, `"supersedes"`, `"related"` |
| `target` | string | YES | Target artifact ID |
| `version` | integer | no | Specific version of the target (omit for latest) |

Relationships are informational. Consumers MAY use them for dependency resolution but MUST NOT require them for correct envelope processing.

### 10.5 Optimistic Locking

The `version` field provides optimistic concurrency control. For non-`full` operations, the apply engine validates `stored_version == version - 1`. State transitions follow the same rule.

For advisory (non-mandatory) locking, an optional `lock` object may be included in `content`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `held_by` | string | Principal holding the lock |
| `acquired_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| `ttl` | integer | Lock duration in seconds (auto-releases after expiry) |

Advisory locks are hints only. The version mechanism remains the authoritative concurrency control.

### 10.6 TTL and Expiration

- When `ttl` is set, the artifact expires at `operation.updated_at + ttl` seconds
- When `expires_at` is set, it takes precedence over `ttl`
- Expired artifacts SHOULD transition to `"archived"` state automatically
- Consumers SHOULD check expiration on read and treat expired artifacts as archived

---

## 11. Conformance Levels

Implementations declare their conformance level. Each level is a superset of the previous.

### Level 0 — Basic

- MUST parse and produce valid envelopes
- MUST support `name: "full"`
- MUST validate `protocol` field

### Level 1 — Incremental

- Level 0, plus:
- MUST support `name: "diff"` with all addressing modes (section, line, offset, search)
- MUST support `name: "section"`
- MUST maintain version chain and enforce version concurrency

### Level 2 — Template

- Level 1, plus:
- MUST support `name: "template"` with Mustache-subset slot syntax
- MUST support template registration (store and reuse by ID)

### Level 3 — Full Protocol

- Level 2, plus:
- MUST support `name: "composite"` with ref, uri, and content includes
- MUST support `operation.content_encoding` (gzip and zstd)
- MUST support streaming chunk frames (JSONL)
- MUST support token budgeting (`operation.token_budget` and `operation.tokens_used`)
- MUST support adaptive flush strategy

### Level 4 — Extended

- Level 3, plus:
- MUST support SSE transport binding ([AAP-SSE](aap-sse.md))
- MUST support `operation.state` and enforce state machine transitions ([Section 10.1](#101-state-machine))
- MUST support entity metadata storage and retrieval ([Section 10.2](#102-entity-metadata))
- MUST enforce TTL/expiration ([Section 10.6](#106-ttl-and-expiration))

### Application Profile: Managed Artifacts

Levels 0-4 above are **wire-format conformance** — they define which data shapes an implementation can parse and produce. The Managed Artifacts profile is **architectural conformance** — it defines how secondary contexts interact with artifacts at runtime via the context-offloading architecture described in [Section 8](#8-artifact-type-interface). It requires Level 4 as a prerequisite.

- Level 4, plus:
- MUST implement the Artifact Type Interface ([Section 8](#8-artifact-type-interface)): create, read, summarize, edit, audit
- MUST support context offloading: init context for creation, maintain context for edits and summarization. The orchestrator MUST provide a mechanism (tool calls, API dispatch, subprocess invocation, or equivalent) for secondary contexts to operate on artifacts
- MUST support the stateless dispatch memory model — no edit history accumulates in any secondary context
- The maintain context MUST produce `diff`, `section`, or `template` envelopes, not `full`, on edits
- MUST support all five control-plane envelope types: `handle`, `projection`, `intent`, `result`, `audit`
- MUST support all four result status codes: `applied`, `rejected`, `partial`, `conflict`
- MUST produce audit entries for every operation, including failures
- Orchestrators MUST use projections rather than reads for context inspection

---

## 12. Security Considerations

- **Content injection**: consumers MUST sanitize artifact content before displaying in privileged contexts (e.g., web browsers). Content display and sandboxing are consumer responsibilities outside the protocol scope
- **URI resolution**: `composite` URIs MUST be validated against an allowlist; arbitrary URI fetch is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) risk
- **Checksum verification**: consumers SHOULD verify `operation.checksum` when present to detect tampering or corruption
- **Token budget enforcement**: producers MUST NOT exceed declared budgets; consumers SHOULD reject payloads that claim to use fewer tokens than they actually contain
- **Entity permissions**: `permissions` in the entity object are metadata only — consumers MUST enforce access control at the platform level, not rely solely on envelope metadata

---

## 13. IANA Considerations

This specification does not require any IANA registrations. The `operation.format` field uses existing MIME types.

---
